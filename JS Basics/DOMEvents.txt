Events - Signals indicating occurence of something
    a. click - When an element is clicked
    b. mouseenter - When a element is entered by the cursor

Event listener - element.addEventListener(event, callback) Allows assigning multiple 
                 functions
                 |
                \|/
                "this" is used to perform actions on the callback obj
Eg:
let btn = document.querySelector("button");
btn.addEventListener("click", function(){
    console.log("Button, clicked");
});

event argument - default argument in eventlistener
Eg:
let btn = document.querySelector("button");
btn.addEventListener("click", function(event){
    console.dir(event);
});

Keyboard Events
Eg: -keydown- When a key is pressed
    -keyup - When a key is released

    Here we use event argument and its properties 
        a. code - returns the code of the key pressed
        b. key - returns the key that was pressed

NOTE : event.preventDefault() to prevent default actions of form

Form Events
Eg:
let form = document.querySelector("form");
form.addEventListener("submit",(event)=>{
    event.preventDefault();
    console.log(form.value); //Gives the text input by user in the form
})

}
