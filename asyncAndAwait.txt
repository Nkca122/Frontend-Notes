callback hell => 
Eg You have to change the color of a heading 
with one second delays then

let h1 = document.querySelector("h1");

function changeColour(color, delay, nextColorChange){
    setTimeout(()=>{
        h1.style.color = color;
        if(nextColorChange) nextColorChange();
    },delay);
}

changeColor("red", 1000, ()=>{
    changeColor("green",1000, ()=> {
        changeColor("orange", 1000);
    });
});

// A very tedious method
// This nesting of callbacks is called
//callback hell

Solution - promises

async and await keywords

async - Creates an async function, which always returns a promise

await - pauses the execution of its surrounding async function untill promise is settled
