>Allows a function to take an indefinite number of 
 arguments and bundle them in an array

Eg:
function sum(...args){
    let sum = 0;
    for(value of args){
        sum += value;
}

return sum;
}


//Note this array by default is called arguments, 
//but does not completely behave like an array as 
//its methods are not applicable
